## Hey there ğŸ‘‹

I'm Marija, a girl born and raised in **Belgrade, Serbia ğŸ‡·ğŸ‡¸**, who fell in love with the STEM field at the age of 10. Chasing my dreams led me all the way to **Lausanne, Switzerland ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡­**, where I'm on adventure of gaining new knowledge and experiences!  

I completed my **BSc in Electrical Engineering and Computing** âš¡ğŸ’» @ University of Belgrade, School of Electrical Engineering and I'm now studying towards **MSc in Life Sciences Engineering with Minor in Data Science** ğŸ§¬ğŸ“Š @ EPFL.  

My GitHub page contains everything I've worked on during my **Master's at EPFL**, mainly cool projects and assignments that were part of my coursework.  

Come take a look! ğŸ‘€ğŸš€
