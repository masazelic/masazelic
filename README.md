## Hey there 👋

I'm Marija, a girl born and raised in **Belgrade, Serbia 🇷🇸**, who fell in love with the STEM field at the age of 10. Chasing my dreams led me all the way to **Lausanne, Switzerland 🇨🇭**, where I'm on adventure of gaining new knowledge and experiences!  

I completed my **BSc in Electrical Engineering and Computing** ⚡💻 @ University of Belgrade, School of Electrical Engineering and I'm now studying towards **MSc in Life Sciences Engineering with Minor in Data Science** 🧬📊 @ EPFL. Currently, I'm mostly interested in ML/AI and its applications into biomedical field.

My GitHub page contains everything I've worked on during my **Master's at EPFL**, mainly cool projects and assignments that were part of my coursework.  

Come take a look! 👀🚀  

### CS-401: Applied Data Analysis  

* [Homework 1](https://github.com/masazelic/ada-2024-homework-1-adavengers) - Pandas, Data Wrangling, and Data Visualization
* [Homework 2](https://github.com/masazelic/ada-2024-homework-2-adavengers) - Preprocessing data to make it amenable to statistical analysis and machine learning models. Training and testing out-of-the box machine learning models in `sklearn`. Carrying out simple multivariate regression analysis using `statsmodel`. Usage of propensity score machine to conduct causal analysis.
* [Project](https://github.com/masazelic/ada-2024-project-adavengers) - Analyzing beer preferences across U.S. states 🇺🇸🍻 and whether they can be linked to their political affiliation. **Scored maximum 100/100 points and was placed among top 10 best projects 🏆 at the course.**

### BIO-501: Lab Immersion

[Semester project](https://github.com/masazelic/Fine-tuning-MSA-Transformer) @ Laboratory of Computational Biology and Theoretical Biophysics (Bitbol lab). Worked on capturing phylogenetic relationships using transformer-based deep learning architecture (MSA Transformer) and synthetic protein multiple sequence alignments (MSA). Built in `python` using `esm`, `PyTorch` and `peft` libraries and Cluster computing.

### COM-490: Large Scale Data Science for Real-World Data

* [Assignments](https://github.com/masazelic/lsds-assignments/tree/main) - Covering various data science techniques especially for handling large scale real-world data.
* [Project](https://github.com/masazelic/SBBG) - `Python` based robust journey planner for the SBB (Swiss Federal Railways). The planner calculates the fastest routes between stops, providing a list of routes with confidence levels. **Project was graded with maximum grade of 6.**

### BIO-463: Genomics and Bioinformatics  

[Repository](https://github.com/masazelic/genomics-bioinformatics/tree/main) contains two assigments and mini project.  
**First assignment** contains scientific analysis in `R` on phylogenetic relationships and population genetics.  
**Second assignment** contains scientific analysis in `R` on bulk RNA sequencing, alternative splicing and single-cell RNA sequecing data.  
**Mini project** contains reproduction of results from the paper [Gene Expression Profile on Human Mesenchymal Stromal Cells Exposed to Hypoxic and Pseudohypoxic Preconditioning - an Analysis by RNA Sequencing](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34360925/) accompanied with report and the code in `R`.
